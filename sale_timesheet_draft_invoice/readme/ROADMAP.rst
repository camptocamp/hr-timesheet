* Recompute quantities on invoice lines

Since this addon allows linking of cancelled and draft invoices
it would be better to force recomputing of quantities when switching state.
set to draft again, unfortunatelly it will not have impact on qty in invoice lines.
To force recomputing qty need to recreate invoice.
